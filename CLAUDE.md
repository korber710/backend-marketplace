# Stop and Validate

- After implementing a complete feature
- Before starting with a new major component
- When you get bad vibes
- Before declaring you are "done"

Run: `poetry run ruff check .` and `poetry run pytest ./tests -vv`

# Project Status

- Right now we are focusing only on MVP1
- Read the specification located at `docs/specification.md` before doing any changes
